# Notes

## 1. What are the technologies we will use?

- NestJS, Why not entirely Express? - Because Express is very bare minimum
- Database - Postgresql (Open source relational DB)
- TypeORM - ORM for interacting with Database
- TypeScript

## 2. What we will be implementing?

- demo: https://demo.realworld.io/#/
- api spec: https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction
- we will not build the frontend but we will use the existing frontend code from the source above
- we will only build the backend using NestJS

## 3. Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- Follow nest installation guide from: https://docs.nestjs.com/
- postman

## 4. Module, controllers and providers

- A module is a class annotated with a @Module() decorator. The @Module() decorator provides metadata that Nest makes use of to organize the application structure.
- Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.

## 5. Build Tag Module

## 6. Create Tag Service

## 7. Configuring absolute path and the start script

- use module-alias package for supporting absolute path for the JS files
- configure paths in tsconfig.json file for supporting absolute path for the ts files
- `ts-node`: ts-node is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js. And used for dev mode
- `tsconfig-paths`: Use this to load modules whose location is specified in the paths section of tsconfig.json
- use nodemon package for using watch mode while starting server in dev

## 8. Postgres setup

- why postgres? a relational db? and not document based db e.g: MongoDB?

  - because MongoDB does not have schema by default. Although relations b/w documents can be built with mongo, still it will need some additional efforts but with Postgres, it is very easy to build relations b/w tables.

- why postgres? why not other relational db like MySQL?

  - MySQL is also a good choice but Postgres is more advanced and has more features than MySQL. MySQL is more suitable for small scale applications.

- download and isntall postgresql on your machine

  - https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/

- commands:

  - `sudo -u postgres psql`: login to postgres
  - `\l`: list all databases
  - `\c <db_name>`: connect to a database
  - `\dt`: list all tables in the database
  - `\du`: list all users
  - Create database: `CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;`
  - `\q`: quit

- commands I followed:
  - login: `sudo -u kirandash psql -U kirandash -d postgres`
    - here `kirandash` is the postgres username and `postgres` is the database name
  - create database: `create database mediumclone;`
  - create user: `create user mediumclone with encrypted password 'mediumclone';`
  - grant privileges: `grant all privileges on database mediumclone to mediumclone;`
    - check if the privileges are granted: `\l`

## 9 DB connection in NestJS

- `pnpm add @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg`
- we will use https://typeorm.io/ for interacting with the postgresql database
